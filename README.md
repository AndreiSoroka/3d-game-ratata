## Why am I publishing this repository?

I donâ€™t really know.

Originally, my task was simply to try out Babylon.js. That meant just reading the documentation, writing a bit of code,
and forgetting about it. I did the initial quick-and-dirty job, tried what I wanted. Then I did another quick pass -
just straightforward code, without any thought that Iâ€™d have to maintain it. No structure, no planning. For some reason,
though, I kept coming back to it over time, adding another quick fix.

Why? I donâ€™t know. Some kind of anomaly.

I should remove it, but instead, Iâ€™m publishing it ðŸ¤·
